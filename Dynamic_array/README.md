**Dynamic Array implementation's source code.**

For testing purpose, I have written two test files: one for int type and other for
string type.
To generate bin file for any test file, change the value of variable MAINFILE in
Makefile and run make.

**Documentation of the code:**
1. pdf version: Check this file [here](./doc/documentation.pdf)
2. html version: First clone the repo to your local and then go to ./Dynamic_array/doc/html/ and open index.html file in your browser.
